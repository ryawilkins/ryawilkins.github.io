				<h2>Frame Fit and Geometry</h2>
				<div class="left_text">		
					<p>A <span>custom</span> frame calls for a bike fit - how else to determine the relative position of the bike handlebars, seat and crank axle? Points to note:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure the crankset is the correct length.</li>
						<li>Start with a 100mm stem length.</li>
						<li>A previous bike can provide a reference starting point.</li>
						<li>Try hands on the drops, on the hoods and on the bars.</li>
						<li>How do you know the body position is <span>right</span>? Use the no hands test! (This is where you ride along with a good cadence with your hands on the bars and then lift your hands off. With a watcher close by to observe movement either forwards or backwards on the saddle. Ideally when the hands come off, you should remain in the same seated position and not feel like you are moving forwards or backwards.)</li>
						<li>A professional bike fit will include an <span>analysis</span> of pedalling action, efficiency and adjustment of cleats.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>After the bike fit has been determined, it's time for the <span>frame geometry</span>to be calculated. This is the job of the frame builder and designer. Some aspects you may observe:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A lower bottom bracket generally aids stability, especially when going downhill. New pro level bikes from major bicycle manufacturers for races such as Paris-Roubaix are featuring bottom bracket drops of between 70 amd 80mm.</li>
						<li>The seat tube angle is generally around 73 to 73.5 degrees.</li>
						<li>The head tube angle is generally around 72 to 73.5 degrees.</li>
						<li>The trail is ideally 58 to 59mm which allows for ideal handling.</li>
						<li>A decent chain stay length allows for good balance and stability and is generally 415 to 420mm for bikes with 28mm tyres.</li>
						<li>The front center is generally such as to prevent or keep toe overlap to a managable amount. Personally I don't mind toe overlap and have been riding with toe overlap on a fixed gear on the public roads for many years.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Now for <span>components and the paint scheme</span>. This is mainly your job. Some things to keep in mind:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It's cheaper to get the best parts from the start then to upgrade to parts in the near future. Besides you will enjoy having the nicer parts early on.</li>
						<li>The paint scheme will take the longest time and be the hardest decision.</li>
						<li>Besides the frame, the wheels will have a massive bearing on the ride and aerodynamics. Get the best wheels and consider the tyre size. Some wheels are designed (i.e. optimised) specifically for certain tyre widths.</li>
						<li>Carbon handlebars allow for internal routing of the electronic wires for Shimano Di2 for example - assuming the buttons are not to be mounted on the frame (because there is a hole in the bars allowing the wires to pass through), allowing buttons on the end cap position of the bars which is a very neat finish.</li>
						<li>Talk to some of your friends about the paint.</li>
