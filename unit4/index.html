		<p>I wanted one bike that does it all - gravel, road, fast, comfortable - that takes into account the best of bicycle engineering and technology, with a view to where things are heading, that won't be obsolete, that will ride in rain or sunshine and put a big smile across my face. This is the journey.</p>

			<li>Start with requirements</li>
			<li>Fit for a Frame</li>
			<li>It's here</li>
			<li>Add this for all year round riding</li>
